# etchasketch
Etchasketch; This is an implementation of an "etchasketch" using JavaScript. When the user hovers different boxes in the grid design, the boxes will change colors much like making a design on an etchasketch.

This implementation has 3 different modes allowing the user to specify 2 different size boxes or the 3rd mode which allows them to create a multi colored etchasketch design

Getting Started; This code can be implemented as a website on your local machine.

Things of Note; 
This was the first time that I used to JavaScript as more than just a website design tool. Instead I used the JavaScript logic to build an entire web application.
